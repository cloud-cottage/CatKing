# Hobbies 爱好

Strictly speaking, I am an idle person, so I have many hobbies: music, calligraphy, swimming, and raising cats and dogs.

## Music
Music is my biggest hobby, I like retro American music, especially from the 1960s. This is where my name comes from - paying tribute to Elvis, the legendary American figure. I tried to write lyrics, compose music, and sing, but the arrangement is not yet professional. Looking forward to further improving oneself in the future.

## Calligraphy

Another favorite of mine, and these pictures are my practice works.

I have only studied calligraphy for a short period of time, but it has helped me cultivate many highly skilled and renowned artists. My wish is to invest a lot of time in practicing calligraphy every day, but the reality is that there is not enough time. I hope I can achieve it in the future!

## Swimming

I enjoy swimming and am willing to spend time on it, even though my skills are not proficient and I will need to keep in touch in the future.  
Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water.

## Pets


I have a natural love for cats and dogs. I have participated in rescuing stray cats and dogs, and have also owned one dog and five cats at the same time. To be frank, I am a pet expert. If you encounter any issues related to pet care, psychology, or other aspects, you can contact me. I am happy to provide assistance.


## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.
My cat, her name is ***Cream***. I used to take her to Starbucks to pass the time.
